# CmdSpaceship
(WIP) CmdSpaceship was a course I taken in Parallel Processing course with threads in Linux, now fully rewrite using C++ thread library and winsock2.

Project is still WIP, I will update in README.

The winsock2 part I take references from :	

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/complete-server-code

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/complete-client-code

How To Run
---
1. Open server first.
2. Open client with 'localhost' as argument. (Ideally it should swapped out for other ip, but I haven reach that part yet.)
